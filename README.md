# System Testing of Login & Sign-up Functionalities for E-commerce Platform

## Project Overview
This project involved comprehensive system testing of the Login and Sign-up functionalities on an e-commerce platform. The testing process included the development and execution of test cases covering functional, non-functional, and negative scenarios to ensure robust performance and security of the platform's authentication features.

## Project Objectives
- **Validation of Core Functionalities**: Ensuring that the Login and Sign-up processes function correctly under various conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Verifying the system's response to invalid inputs and unexpected user behaviors.
- **Security Testing**: Checking that sensitive data, such as passwords and OTPs, are handled securely throughout the authentication process.

## Key Activities
- **Test Case Development**: Created detailed test cases for both functional and non-functional requirements, focusing on mobile number validation, OTP processing, and secure navigation.
- **Test Execution**: Executed a total of 33 test cases, including both positive and negative scenarios.
- **Reporting**: Documented the test results and findings in a comprehensive report, confirming the stability and readiness of the system for deployment.

## Test Case Highlights
- **Functional Tests**: Verified that the login and sign-up functionalities work as expected, including successful navigation, input validation, and OTP handling.
- **Non-Functional Tests**: Assessed the performance of the login and sign-up pages, ensuring they load quickly and are responsive across different devices.
- **Negative Tests**: Tested the system's response to invalid data inputs, such as incorrect mobile numbers, passwords, and OTPs, ensuring appropriate error messages are displayed.

## Results
- **Pass Rate**: 100% of the test cases passed successfully, indicating that the Login and Sign-up functionalities are operating as intended.
- **Defects Found**: No defects were identified during testing, confirming the system's robustness and reliability.

## Technologies Used
- **Tools**: Microsoft Excel for test case documentation, and manual testing for execution.
- **Languages**: N/A (Manual testing project)
- **Platforms**: The testing was performed on a simulated e-commerce platform environment.

## Project Structure
- **Test Cases**: Detailed test cases for each scenario, stored in Excel files.
- **Test Report**: A comprehensive report summarizing the test results and findings.

## Repository Contents
- `Task1_Test_Cases.xlsx` - Excel file containing all developed test cases.
- `Task2_Test_Execution.xlsx` - Excel file documenting the execution results.
- `Test_Report.pdf` - The final report summarizing the testing process and outcomes.

## Conclusion
The system testing of the Login and Sign-up functionalities has been successfully completed, with all test cases passing. The system demonstrated strong performance, error handling, and security, making it ready for deployment. Further testing is recommended under varied network conditions and device responsiveness to ensure comprehensive coverage.
